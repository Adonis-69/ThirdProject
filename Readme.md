Some of the stuffs i learnt while doing this,
  (i) Margin can take negative values, which pulls and element closer.
  (ii)Accent-color property helps in controlling the colors of checkbox , radio , progress etc.
 (iii)Existence of ::placeholder pseudoelement.
 (iv) Backdrop-filter property , which helps in creating blur effect sort of to an area behind an element.
